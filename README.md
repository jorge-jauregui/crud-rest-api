# Server Side Practice

This project was created with the sole purpose of building a basic CRUD Todo app using Javascript server-side technologies (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) and 
testing the Rest Apis using Postman. This repository consists of a Node.js app, an Express web server, a Mongoose model, routes for client requests, and a 
controller with CRUD functions (create, findAll, findOne, update, delete, deleteAll).
